<h1>Technical Details</h1>
This game utilizes the localStorage API to save your game state across browser sessions. Here's a brief rundown of how it works:

Saving Difficulty Level: When you select a difficulty level, it's saved to localStorage, allowing the game to remember your preference.
Storing Attempts: Each guess is recorded in localStorage, so you can leave the game and come back without losing your progress.
Session Restoration: When you return to the game, it checks localStorage for any saved data and restores your game to the last known state.
